Fake Job Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

🔍 A Real-World Text Classification Project

Fake job postings have become a major threat on online job portals. This project aims to analyze job descriptions and automatically classify them as Genuine or Fake using multiple NLP techniques and machine-learning models.

⭐ Overview

This project performs end-to-end fake job detection using:
Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal)
Feature Engineering (BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Sentence Embeddings)
ML Algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)
Deep Learning Embeddings (Sentence Transformers – BERT-based)
Model Evaluation & Comparison
Interactive Frontend via Streamlit (Upload job text → Predict)
This is a professional-level NLP project showcasing practical industry skills.
